<h2>YAML. List and Comments</h2>
<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
 In the 3rd YAML parsing task, we’re going to look into arrays.
</p>
<p>
 <i>
  (Remember that in this mission you must take into account the conditions of previous missions. It means that your solution should work with dictionaries from a previous mission and with arrays from this one.)
 </i>
</p>
<p>
 A simple example:
</p>
<pre>
- write some
- "Alex Chii"
- 89
</pre>
<pre>
[
  "write some", 
  "Alex Chii", 
  89
]
</pre>
<p>
 As you can see in the above example, the format for values is the same as we’ve used in the previous task for the format of values in the dictionary.
</p>
<p>
 It's time to add comments to the format.
</p>
<p>
 Everything indicated after the # sign should be ignored by the parser.
</p>
<pre>
# comment
- write some # after
# one mor
- "Alex Chii #sir "
- 89 #bl
</pre>
<pre>
[
  "write some", 
  "Alex Chii #sir ", 
  89
]
</pre>
<p>
 As you may have noticed, the comments inside the string aren’t considered as comments, they are treated as part of the string, which makes sense.
</p>
<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
 <strong>
  Input:

  yaml('# comment\n'
 '- write some # after\n'
 '# one mor\n'
 '- "Alex Chii #sir "\n'
 '- 89 #bl') == ['write some', 'Alex Chii #sir ', 89]
</pre>
 
</div>
<!-- Here you can explain some constraints for input-->
<!-- The section is optional -->
