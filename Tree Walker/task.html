 This summer the 4th annual
 <a href="https://pybay.com/" target="_blank" title="PyBay website">
  PyBay
 </a>
 conference dedicated to Python development was held.
    One of the speakers was
 <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondh" target="_blank" title="Raymond's twitter">
  Raymond Hettinger
 </a>
 ,
    a member of the Python Software Foundation (PFS) since 2003, a member of the PFS board of directors from 2008 to 2012.
    Raymond's merits in the PFS are very significant: he worked on creating sets (data type), generator expressions,
    "collections" and "itertools" modules, as well as an ordered dict. He's also well known for his contributions
    to the Python Cookbook.
</p>
<p align="justify">
 Raymond's presentation was called "The Mental Game of Python".
    You can watch the entire recording of the presentation

 .
    Raymond demonstrated using various strategies to simplify the development process and make the code simpler and therefore better.
    This mission is a variation of a data tree traversal task used by Raymond to demonstrate an incremental development approach.

 In computer science, a
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)" target="_blank" title="Tree on Wiki">
  tree
 </a>
 is an abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure.
    All tree elements are called
 <b>
  nodes
 </b>
 . The lines connecting elements (or nodes) are called
 <b>
  branches
 </b>
 and nodes without children are called
 <b>
  leaves
 </b>
 or
 <b>
  end-nodes
 </b>
 .
    The topmost node in a tree is called the
 <b>
  root node
 </b>
 .
 <b>
  Depth
 </b>
 is the distance between a node and the root.
    Additionally, every node in a tree can be seen as the root node of the
 <b>
  subtree
 </b>
 rooted at that node.

 In this mission you are given an arbitrary finite tree and a target. In case the target's type is
 <b>
  int
 </b>
 or
 <b>
  str
 </b>
 your task is to calculate how many leaves of the tree are equal to the target.
    Otherwise, if the target's type is
 <b>
  list
 </b>
 or
 <b>
  dict
 </b>
 you need to calculate the number of subtrees which are equal to the target.

 For a better understanding, have a look at the illustrations below (visual order matters for lists).

 <strong>
  Input:
 </strong>
 Two arguments:
 <ul>
  <li>
   the first is an arbitrary finite
   <b>
    tree
   </b>
   data structure
  </li>
  <li>
   the second is a
   <b>
    target
   </b>
   , any type of [int, str, list, dict]
  </li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Output:
 </strong>
 The number (integer) of the leaves or subtrees that are equal to the given target.
