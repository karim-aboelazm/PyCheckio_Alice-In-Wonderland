<h2>The Fastest Horse</h2>
<!-- Describe task in general -->
<p>
 We have some horse racing statistics  (each horse’s time in each race)
 <br/>
 You have to find the number of the horse which has the most wins.
 <br/>
 For example: if the results are [[“1:13”, “1:26”, “1:11”], [“1:10”, “1:18”, “1:14”], [“1:20”, “1:23”, “1:15”]] then the 3rd horse is the fastest, because it has won 2 races out of 3.
 <br/>
 Every element in the list - is a string in format m:ss, for example, "1:05" or "2:22". 1:00 &lt;= time &lt;= 5:00

 <strong>
  How it is used:
 </strong>
 For data analysis and statistics (finding the needed elements in the huge amount of data).

 <strong>
  Precondition
 </strong>
 :
 <br/>
 2 &lt;= horses &lt;= 10
 <br/>
 1 &lt;= races &lt;= 10
